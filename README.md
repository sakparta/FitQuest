# FitQuest


This is a Fitness Tracker app designed for mobile devices, with the purpose of providing users with goal-oriented support on their wellness journey. 
The app offers users pre-made workout programs that they can follow with the desired level of accuracy and the ability to schedule their activities at a suitable time.

The app allows users to track their calorie expenditure and goal progress, provided that they update their information regularly within the app.

Our goal is to build an app that does not require any special expertise or athletic background to use.
We aim to achieve this goal by following good principles of user interface design and understanding the context of use.
